# GOVERNANCE.md - MARTINS-432-FLOW

## 1. Scope
This document defines the technical governance mechanisms of the MARTINS-432-FLOW protocol.

## 2. Source of Authority
The protocol recognizes a Single Source of Authority (SSA) defined as a cryptographic identity (PGP key) used to sign official releases.

## 3. Official Artifacts
An official version MUST contain:
- Valid integrity/manifest.json
- LICENSE and COMMERCIAL.md unmodified (1.618% Royalty Rule)

## 4. Verification Process
Verification is performed via SHA256 document hashing and public authority key verification.

## 5. Legal Boundary
This governance system provides technical traceability and cryptographic proof of authorship. It does not replace legal jurisdiction but serves as primary forensic evidence.
