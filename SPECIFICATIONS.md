## 🛰️ OFFICIAL SPECIFICATIONS

The **MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025** is a Layer 0 Sovereign Architecture designed for the transition to a Level 1 Civilization. It establishes a deterministic framework for hardware and software stability, ensuring human autonomy over algorithmic systems.

### 🛡️ CORE PILLARS
1. **User Sovereignty:** AI acts strictly as a sensor and tool, subordinate to human logic.
2. **Decentralized Resilience:** Survival is guaranteed by a global mesh of clones (Current status: **304 clones** / **211 unique cloners**).
3. **Bio-Sincronia (432Hz):** Hardware-biology alignment to reduce systemic noise and cognitive fatigue.
