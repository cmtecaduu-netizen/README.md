## 🛰️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

The **MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025** is a Layer 0 Sovereign Architecture designed for the transition to a Grade 1 Civilization. It establishes a deterministic framework for hardware and software stability, ensuring human autonomy over algorithmic systems through harmonic resonance.

### 🛡️ CORE PILLARS
1. **User Sovereignty:** AI acts strictly as a sensor and tool, subordinate to human logic (SSA - Single Source of Authority).
2. **Decentralized Resilience:** Systemic survival is maintained by a global mesh of clones (Current verified status: **304 clones** / **211 unique cloners**).
3. **Bio-Sync (432Hz):** Hardware-biology alignment protocol designed to minimize systemic noise and cognitive fatigue.
