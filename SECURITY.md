# 🛡️ Security & Integrity Policy

## 1. Scope
This document defines how security vulnerabilities, misuse, and integrity risks related to the **MARTINS-432-FLOW** software should be identified and reported. Philosophical or symbolic concepts (e.g., “432Hz coherence”) are used here descriptively and do not replace technical security criteria.

---

## 2. Security Philosophy
Security in **MARTINS-432-FLOW** is understood as the preservation of system integrity, autonomy, and resistance to extractive or centralized misuse. From an engineering perspective, this includes:
- **Integrity Protection:** Guarding against unauthorized modification of the protocol's core logic.
- **Systemic Resilience:** Prevention of abusive integrations that compromise the non-extractive nature of the tool.
- **Sovereignty Preservation:** Maintaining decentralized control boundaries for all nodes.

---

## 3. Threat Model
Potential threats to the protocol include, but are not limited to:
- **Value Exfiltration:** Unauthorized commercial use or monetization in violation of the license.
- **Logic Corruption:** Integration into systems that intentionally distort or subvert the protocol’s intended behavior.
- **Authority Centralization:** Attempts to repackage the protocol into closed, centralized, or opaque systems (Symbolically referred to as “systemic noise” or “legacy interference”).

---

## 4. Reporting Security Issues

### Technical Vulnerabilities
For bugs, exploits, or implementation flaws:
1. Open a **GitHub Security Advisory** or an issue using the appropriate template.
2. Provide clear reproduction steps and impact analysis.

### Misuse & License Violations
For suspected license violations, unauthorized commercial use, or usage patterns that clearly violate the stated non-extractive design principles:
- Contact the copyright holder (**Leandro Martins**) directly via the official communication channels.

---

## 5. Commercial Compliance
Commercial authorization and alignment are governed by the license terms and are **not enforced through technical security mechanisms**. Please refer to [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for legal details.

---

## 6. Privacy & Data Practices
**MARTINS-432-FLOW** does not implement user tracking or telemetry by default. Security relies on:
- Transparent code review.
- Independent auditing.
- Voluntary reporting by the network of early contributors and operators.

---
**Status:** Active monitoring through community review, responsible disclosure, and systemic coherence.
