# 🛡️ Security & Frequency Policy – AELOH-432

## Purpose
This document ensures the integrity of the AELOH-432 protocol. Security here is defined as the protection of the 432Hz harmonic field and the responsible expansion of Level 1 technology.

## Resonance Guidelines (Allowed Use)
- **Scientific Research:** You are encouraged to study, test, and experiment with the code to understand the stabilization of matter through frequency.
- **Academic Integration:** Use for education and individual evolution is fully supported under the AELOH-432 vision.

## Integrity & Commercial Alignment
- **Sovereign Authorization:** To maintain the ethical frequency of this protocol, any commercial implementation must be aligned with the Architect (Leandro Martins).
- **Sustainability:** Support for the mission and official authorization for scaling are managed exclusively via GitHub Sponsors and Stripe.

## Reporting Interference
If you detect vulnerabilities, misuse of the protocol in low-frequency (440Hz) destructive systems, or unauthorized commercial exploits, please open a **Vulnerability Report** via GitHub Issues.

## Scope
This project operates on the principle of **Self-Sovereignty**. We do not track users. We rely on the ethical resonance of the Elite Allies to maintain the protocol's purity.
