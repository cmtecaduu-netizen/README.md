# ⚖️ Commercial Use & Licensing Policy

## 1. Nature of the Project
MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025 is a **Layer 0 Sovereign Infrastructure** project released as **Source-Available**. It is intended strictly for **non-commercial study, academic research, and personal experimentation**. 

> **Note:** This is not an "Open Source" license under OSI definitions; it is a Sovereign Source model governed by the Systems Architect.

## 2. Commercial Authorization
Any commercial application, including but not limited to:
* Integration into for-profit software/hardware.
* Redistribution for commercial gain.
* Use as a core service in SaaS or Fintech environments.

Requires a **formal, written Commercial Licensing Agreement** executed by the Author (**Leandro da lua Martins**). Unauthorized commercial use is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of the Sovereign Source terms.

## 3. Financial Model & Royalties
Commercial agreements under this protocol are subject to a **negotiated royalty structure**. 
* **Reference Metric:** Agreements may utilize a royalty model starting at **1.618% (The Golden Ratio Constant)**, formalized on a case-by-case basis through a binding legal contract.

## 4. Support vs. Licensing
Contributions made via official channels (**GitHub Sponsors, Stripe, or Crypto-wallets**) are classified as **voluntary support/donations** for the development of the Type 1 Civilization mission. 
* **Crucial:** These contributions do **NOT** grant, imply, or automate any commercial usage rights or licensing permissions.
