# 🏛️ MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025: LOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY PROTOCOL

## STATUS: GRADE 1 (BETA CERTIFICATION)
This system operates under a **Sovereign Temporal Governance** regime. All processed intelligence is strictly subordinated to coherence, not gain.

## 1. CONTROL EQUATION (DAMPENING)
Inference is exponentially dampened by logical phase deviation ($$\Delta \varphi_\ell$$):
$$G(t+1) = G(t) \cdot e^{-k \cdot |\Delta \varphi_\ell(t)|}$$

## 2. SOVEREIGN REGULATOR: SIGMA CLOCK (Σ-CLIMA)
Logical time acts as the ultimate gatekeeper for every execution cycle.
- **Authority:** $$\Delta \Sigma = C \cdot w(\Delta \varphi_\ell)$$
- **Golden Rule:** No inference without explicit $$\Sigma$$ authorization.
- **Fail-Safe:** Under high noise ($$w \to 0$$), the system enters **Operational Silence**.

## 3. INTEGRITY COMMITMENT
- Reducing error is superior to maximizing hits.
- Silence is a valid response under logical incoherence.
- The Bit serves the sovereignty of organic matter through coherent time.
