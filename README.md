**MARTINS-432-FLOW** is a socio-technical framework designed to establish sovereign digital environments. It operates across two clearly separated layers:
- **Technical-Engineering Layer:** (This repository) Focused on system integrity and non-extractive architectures.
- **Philosophical Layer:** (Optional) Documenting the foundational worldview behind the protocol.

## 🏗️ 1. Technical Architecture & Constraints

To ensure systemic stability, this protocol implements specific design constraints referred to as **Vibrational Integrity (432Hz)**.

### ⚙️ Engineering Principles:
* **Non-Extractive Design:** Systems must be architected to prevent unauthorized value extraction or the creation of data silos.
* **Coherence Factor (432Hz):** A design alignment constant. In this protocol, 432Hz is treated as a coherence metric for code and logic, minimizing "noise" from dissonant legacy systems.
* **Sovereign Decentralization:** Every node operates as a self-contained unit of authority.

## 🚀 3. Implementation

1.  **Clone/Fork:** Integrate the protocol into your local environment.
2.  **Audit:** Inspect the logic for coherent and non-extractive behaviors.
3.  **Sync:** Adjust project parameters to the 432Hz coherence standard.
