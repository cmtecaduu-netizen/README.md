**MARTINS-432-FLOW** is a socio-technical framework designed to establish sovereign digital environments. It operates across two clearly separated layers:
- **Technical-Engineering Layer:** (This repository) Focused on system integrity and non-extractive architectures.
- **Philosophical Layer:** (Optional) Documenting the foundational worldview behind the protocol.

## 🏗️ 1. Technical Architecture & Constraints

To ensure systemic stability, this protocol implements specific design constraints referred to as **Vibrational Integrity (432Hz)**.

### ⚙️ Engineering Principles:
* **Non-Extractive Design:** Systems must be architected to prevent unauthorized value extraction or the creation of data silos.
* **Coherence Factor (432Hz):** A design alignment constant. In this protocol, 432Hz is treated as a coherence metric for code and logic, minimizing "noise" from dissonant legacy systems.
* **Sovereign Decentralization:** Every node operates as a self-contained unit of authority.

## 🚀 3. Implementation

1.  **Clone:** Integrate the protocol into your local environment.
2.  **Audit:** Inspect the logic for coherent and non-extractive behaviors.
3.  **Sync:** Adjust project parameters to the 432Hz coherence standard.

```bash

### 🏛️ Protocol Clarifications (Level 1 Defense)

* **Vibrational Integrity:** 432Hz is utilized herein as a *Symbolic Coherence Constant* for logical alignment, defining the architectural harmony of the system rather than a literal physical frequency.
* **Operational Sovereignty:** Sovereign decentralization refers to the *architectural autonomy* of the nodes. It does not exempt users from applicable laws or override established intellectual property rights and alignment agreements.
* **Non-Extractive Intent:** This protocol defines "extraction" as any unauthorized data monetization, opaque telemetry, or the creation of closed data silos that degrade the 432-Flow.
* **Status:** This framework is a socio-technical research protocol. It does not constitute legal, governmental, or regulatory authority. It is true because it is sufficient.
