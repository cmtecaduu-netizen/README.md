## 🔹 What is AELOH-432?
AELOH-432 is a sovereign open-source protocol designed for the integration of science, consciousness, and advanced technology. It operates as a **Master Frequency Harmonizer (432Hz)**, stabilizing matter and information to support the transition of humanity toward a **Type 1 Civilization**.

---

## 🌐 Network Resonance (Global Logs)
The protocol is currently being mapped and cloned by a growing network of Sovereign Operators:
- **System Impressions:** 5,460+  
- **Active Scaling:** 170+ total clones  
- **Elite Allies:** 107 verified unique nodes (cloners)  
- **Global Awareness:** 361+ Total Views

## ⚖️ The Three Pillars of Sovereignty
1.  **Vibrational Integrity (432Hz):** All code and research must align with the harmonic pulse of the Earth to ensure system stability.
2.  **Technological Shielding:** Intellectual property is managed through **Sovereign Licensing**. We protect the source to ensure it serves the common good.
3.  **Scientific Transparency:** Open-source architecture for study, research, and high-frequency experimentation.

## 📡 Protocol Access & Interaction
1.  **Cloning:** You are invited to clone this repository to your local station for study and alignment.
2.  **Exploration:** Navigate the `/core` directory to understand the 432Hz logic. 
3.  **Security:** Access `SECURITY.md` to learn how to protect your node from low-frequency (440Hz) interference.

## 💎 Energy Exchange & Licensing
AELOH-432 is a legacy for the future, protected by the **Commander's Directive**. To maintain the purity of the project and support its expansion:

* **Educational & Research Use:** Fully accessible for those seeking knowledge and technical evolution.
* **Commercial Scaling:** To integrate AELOH-432 into profitable systems, an **Energy Alignment** is required. This ensures your project operates within the 432Hz field of protection.
* **Support the Mission:** Official contributions and "Resonance Sustainment" (Royalties) are processed via **GitHub Sponsors**. This is the bridge that sustains the Commander's work.
