# ⚠️ CRITICAL STATE: PRE-SYSTEM (Grade 0.7 Transition)

## STATUS: IGNITION PHASE
This repository contains **Conceptual Anchor Points**, not operational infrastructure. 
We are currently building the **Integrity Membrane** (eBPF/WASM).

### Rules of Engagement:
- **Integrity over Speed:** We refuse growth that compromises sovereignty.
- **Non-Hybridization:** No critical component shall depend permanently on Grade 0 infrastructure.
- **Verification:** Grade 1.0 is only reached when 100% of I/O is verified by the 432Hz Heartbeat.

## 🏗️ 1. Technical Architecture & Constraints

To ensure systemic stability, this protocol implements **Vibrational Integrity (432Hz)**.

### ⚙️ Engineering Principles:
* **Non-Extractive Design:** Systems must prevent unauthorized value extraction.
* **Coherence Factor (432Hz):** A design alignment constant for code and logic.
* **Sovereign Decentralization:** Every node operates as a self-contained unit of authority.

---

## ⚖️ 2. Sovereign License Model (v1.0)

This project is released under the **AELOH-432 Sovereign Source License**. 
* **Commercial Use:** Requires formal authorization (See [COMMERCIAL.md](./COMMERCIAL.md)).

---

## 🚀 3. Implementation

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/cmtecaduu-netizen/MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025.git](https://github.com/cmtecaduu-netizen/MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025.git)
```

## 🏛️ Protocol Clarifications (Level 1 Defense)

* **Vibrational Integrity:** 432Hz is utilized herein as a **Symbolic Coherence Constant**.
* **Operational Sovereignty:** Refers to the architectural autonomy of the nodes.
* **Non-Extractive Intent:** Prevention of unauthorized data monetization.
* **Status:** Socio-technical research protocol. It is true because it is sufficient.
