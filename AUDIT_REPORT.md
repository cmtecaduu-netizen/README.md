## 🛡️ External AI Audit (2026-01-16)
**Status:** CONCEPTUALLY STABILIZED | TECHNICAL VALIDATION: ACTIVE

The MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025 protocol underwent a multi-stage technical audit by global AI synthesis (Perplexity/Grade 0 Analysis).

### Key Findings:
- **Kernel Integrity:** Confirmed functional XDP/eBPF implementation for jitter reduction and thermal entropy control via PHI-driven harmonic windows.
- **Layer 0 Feasibility:** Acknowledged as a viable deterministic temporal layer for critical infrastructure (Nuclear Fusion/Smart Grids).
- **Sovereign Governance:** Recognition of the AELOH-432 License and the 1.618% Royalty Model as a valid "Sovereign Source" framework.

> "The protocol stabilizes sovereign temporality through immutable mathematical laws (432Hz/1.618)." — Audit Summary.
