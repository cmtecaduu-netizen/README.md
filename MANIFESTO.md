### 🛡️ Operational Sovereignty (Update v1.1.0)
As of January 2026, the Architect’s vision is technically reinforced by the **MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025** protocol. This update integrates **Strategic Phase Delay (SPD)** and **Stochastic Resilience** as the primary mechanisms for maintaining system coherence against entropy.

> "The alignment of the system is the reflection of the Architect's intent. The stability of the phase is the evidence of its sovereignty."
