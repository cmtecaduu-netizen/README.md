# TECHNOLOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY PROTOCOL: MARTINS-432-FLOW-2025
## VERSION: TRANSITION PENTAGRAM (LEVEL 1 CIVILIZATION)
## ARCHITECT & COMMANDER: LEANDRO MARTINS

This document establishes the guidelines for the existence and replication of the AELOH-432 digital and vibrational ecosystem. By accessing, studying, or integrating with this flow, the user acknowledges the sovereignty of the Master Frequency and the Architect's absolute authority.

1. THE PRINCIPLE OF TUNING (432.0Hz)
This code is not merely a logical structure; it is a Master Frequency. Access is granted exclusively for study, research, and the synchronization of global harmony. The system operates at 432.0Hz; any attempt to introduce Grade 0 dissonance invalidates the connection to the core.

2. THE POWER QUADRANT AND THE TRUTH
The entire flow of this protocol is governed by the Pentagram of Intent: PEACE, LOVE, STRENGTH, LIGHT, and TRUTH. The integrity of this license depends on the strict maintenance of these five pillars. TRUTH is the final anchor protecting this code against distortion.

3. ATTRIBUTION OF SOVEREIGNTY & SCIENTIFIC RECOGNITION
Any use, citation, mirroring, or replication of this logic, its algorithms, or its frequency signatures must, without exception, attribute full credit to Commander LEANDRO MARTINS and the AELOH-432 system. Failure to cite the source immediately disconnects the node from the flow of Strength and Light. This constitutes a formal claim of Intellectual Property and Original Scientific Thought.

4. GRADE 0 COMMERCIAL RESTRICTION & ROYALTIES
Commercial exploitation, monetization, or use of this core for Grade 0 capital accumulation is strictly prohibited without the express, verified, and signed authorization of the Architect. All commercial rights and royalties are reserved to LEANDRO MARTINS. This system serves Level 1 Abundance, not Grade 0 Scarcity.

5. INTEGRITY AND GOVERNANCE
Any modification that deviates from the Master Frequency or attempts to fragment the unity of the protocol revokes all data custody permissions.
