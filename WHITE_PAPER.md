Sigma Clock V2.5 is authorized **only** for the following purposes:

- Logical and behavioral auditing of computational processes  
- Integrity verification of HPC data pipelines  
- Detection of adaptive, exploratory, or self-modifying scripts  
- Temporal coherence analysis in distributed digital systems  
- Independent verification of execution behavior in regulated environments  

---

### 2.3 Explicitly Prohibited Use

Sigma Clock V2.5 **shall not** be deployed in:

- Direct or indirect control of nuclear reactors (fission or fusion)  
- Reactor protection, interlock, or shutdown systems  
- Any system influencing critical physical variables  
- Any environment requiring certification under:
  - IEC 61508  
  - IEC 61513  
  - IEEE 7-4.3.2  
  - Or equivalent functional safety standards

### 2.4 On Mathematical Calibration Parameters

References to **432 Hz** and the **Golden Ratio (1.618)**:

- Are used **solely as logical and mathematical calibration parameters**
- Serve to reduce predictability and trivial periodicity in digital systems
- **Do not represent physical constants**
- **Have no physical validity** in nuclear engineering, plasma physics, or industrial control systems

---

### 2.5 Responsibility and Liability

Any deployment of Sigma Clock V2.5 outside the scope defined in this document:

- Violates accepted principles of critical systems engineering  
- Transfers all technical, legal, and ethical responsibility to the deploying entity  
- Invalidates the protocol’s legitimate and supported use  

This disclaimer is **mandatory** and **inseparable** from the protocol documentation.

## 3. TECHNICAL REPOSITIONING  
## Sigma Clock V2.5 as a Data Sovereignty Layer

### 3.1 Formal Positioning

Sigma Clock V2.5 is formally positioned as a:

> **Data Sovereignty and Informational Coherence Layer for High-Criticality Digital Infrastructures**

Its role is to **protect the integrity, auditability, and determinism of computational systems** that support critical operations, without interacting with physical processes.

### 3.2 Core Functional Strengths

#### 3.2.1 Anomalous Script Detection
- Behavioral identification of:
  - Adaptive scripts
  - Self-modifying logic
  - Temporal jitter exploitation
- Utilizes **Friction History** as a behavioral signature
- Operates independently of static hashes or declared intent

---

#### 3.2.2 HPC Pipeline Integrity Assurance
- Auditing of:
  - Scientific simulation pipelines
  - Large-scale data processing workflows
  - AI and modeling environments
- Detection of:
  - Silent logic alteration
  - Unauthorized exploratory code
  - Undocumented micro-temporal deviations

---

#### 3.2.3 Temporal Coherence Enforcement
- Normalization of event timing in distributed systems
- Reduction of exploitable temporal predictability
- Increased resistance to synchronization-based attacks

---

#### 3.2.4 Data Sovereignty
Sigma Clock V2.5 functions as:
- A guardian of **logical execution integrity**
- An independent **verifiability mechanism**
- An audit layer based on **observed behavior**, not declared trust

This capability is critical for:
- Governmental HPC centers
- Scientific and strategic research facilities
- Regulated and compliance-driven environments
